# Unseen Details: The Hidden World of Photo Metadata

Every photo you take contains a hidden layer of information called metadata. This digital footprint reveals more than you might expect - from your location to your camera model. Let's explore what's hiding in your images and how to protect your privacy.

## The 3 Main Types of Photo Metadata

1. **EXIF Data (Exchangeable Image File Format)**:
   - GPS coordinates (exact location where photo was taken)
   - Timestamp (date and precise time)
   - Camera model and settings (shutter speed, aperture, ISO)
   - Device serial number

2. **IPTC Data (International Press Telecommunications Council)**:
   - Copyright information
   - Photographer credits
   - Image captions and keywords
   - Usage rights information

3. **XMP Data (Extensible Metadata Platform)**:
   - Adobe-specific editing history
   - Software used for modifications
   - Copyright status
   - AI-generated image tags

## Why Photo Metadata Matters for Privacy

- 📍 **Location tracking**: GPS coordinates can pinpoint your home, workplace, or vacation spots
- ⏰ **Behavior patterns**: Timestamps reveal your daily routines
- 🔍 **Device identification**: Serial numbers can link multiple photos to you
- ⚖️ **Legal risks**: Copyright metadata can expose unauthorized image usage
