When you share files online, you're revealing far more than the visible content. Hidden metadata creates privacy vulnerabilities that most users never consider. Here's why you should always remove metadata before sharing any file.

## The Invisible Privacy Breach: What's at Risk

### 1. **Personal Identification**

- Name and contact info in documents
- Device serial numbers in photos
- Author credentials in PDFs

### 2. **Location Exposure**

- GPS coordinates in images and videos
- Location history in document metadata
- Address data from mapping files

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**

- File creation/editing timelines
- Collaboration history
- Usage frequency statistics

### 4. **Security Vulnerabilities**

- Software version exploits
- Undisclosed file relationships
- Hidden revision comments

## File-Specific Risks and Solutions

| File Type | Common Metadata Risks                                  | Removal Method                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Photos    | GPS coordinates, Camera model, Facial recognition data | PrivMeta's EXIF cleaner         |

| PDFs      | Creation software, Signatures, Encryption status       | PrivMeta's PDF metadata remover |
| Videos    | Location, Device info, Creation date                   | PrivMeta's video processor      |
| Audio     | Recording device, Timestamps, Artist info              | PrivMeta's audio metadata tool  |

## The Privacy Cascade Effect

A single file with metadata can trigger an exposure chain reaction:

1. Photo shared online contains GPS coordinates
2. Coordinates match your home address
3. Address links to property records
4. Records reveal financial information
5. Financial data connects to other accounts
