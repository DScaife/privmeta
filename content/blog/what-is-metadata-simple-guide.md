Metadata is "data about data" - information that describes other information. Think of it like a digital ID card for your files. Just like your ID card has your name, photo, and birth date without containing your actual body, metadata describes a file without being the main content.

## Common Examples of Metadata

1. **Photos**:

   - Where and when taken (GPS coordinates, timestamp)
   - Camera model and settings
   - People identified (facial recognition data)

2. **Documents**:

   - Author name and creation date
   - Document version history
   - Comments and tracked changes

3. **Emails**:
   - Sender and recipient addresses
   - Timestamps for sending/receiving
   - Email server routing information

## Why Metadata Matters for Privacy

Metadata can reveal sensitive information even when the main content seems harmless:

- A photo's GPS coordinates can reveal your home address
- Document authorship can expose confidential sources
- File creation dates can track your activities
